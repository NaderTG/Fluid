  abstract = {.We survey here some recent studies concerning what we call mean-field models by analogy with Statistical Mechanics and Physics. More precisely, we present three examples of our mean-field approach to modelling in Economics and Finance (or other related subjects...). Roughly speaking, we are concerned with situations that involve a very large number of ?rational players? with a limited information (or visibility) on the ?game?. Each player chooses his optimal strategy in view of the global (or macroscopic) informations that are available to him and that result from the actions of all players. In the three examples we mention here, we derive a mean-field problem which consists in nonlinear differential equations. These equations are of a new type and our main goal here is to study them and establish their links with various fields of Analysis. We show in particular that these nonlinear problems are essentially well-posed problems i.e., have unique solutions. In addition, we give various limiting cases, examples and possible extensions. And we mention many open problems.},

  abstract = {Over the last 50 years quantum mechanics has come to be applied in very sophisticated ways. Some of these applications involve the control and observation of quantum systems using subtle noncommutative effects. However only recently has there been any attempt to look at these from a control theory perspective. In this paper we cast some of the main ideas from Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) as applied to imaging and spectroscopy in a system theoretic framework. For example, NMR spectroscopy is taken to be a system identification problem. Many key aspects of high resolution NMR spectroscopy involve manipulating and controlling nuclear spins in such a way as to generate a suitable signal for the identification problem. This active control of nuclear spin is presented as a problem in the control of nonlinear systems.},
